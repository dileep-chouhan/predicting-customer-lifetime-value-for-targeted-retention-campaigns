# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value for Targeted Retention Campaigns

**Overview:**

This project focuses on customer segmentation for a retail business to optimize retention marketing spend and maximize ROI.  We predict customer lifetime value (CLTV) using various customer attributes and then segment customers into distinct groups based on their predicted CLTV. This allows for targeted marketing campaigns, focusing resources on high-value customers and improving the efficiency of retention strategies.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, CLTV prediction using appropriate machine learning models, and visualization of the results.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Example Output:**

The script will print key analytical results to the console, including summary statistics of the CLTV predictions and details on the customer segments created.  Additionally, the script will generate several plot files visualizing key aspects of the analysis, such as:

* `cltv_distribution.png`: A histogram showing the distribution of predicted CLTV values.
* `segment_comparison.png`: A bar chart comparing key metrics across different customer segments.


**Data:**  (Add a section here if you have specific data requirements or details about the data used. For example, you could mention the source of the data, its format, and any preprocessing steps needed.)


**Further Development:** (Optional)  Add a section outlining potential future improvements or extensions to the project.  For example:

* Explore alternative CLTV prediction models.
* Incorporate additional customer data features.
* Develop a more sophisticated customer segmentation strategy.
* Integrate with marketing automation tools.


**Contributing:** (Optional)  Add a section outlining contribution guidelines if you plan to accept contributions from others.
